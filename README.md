# Pi-MS-20

## Experimentations and tooling into driving Korg MS-20 Modular synth with Raspberry Pi GPIO using minimal additional components

### Outline

* Direct Control Votages are out - 

* Raspberry PI Hardware-based Pulse Width Modulation can be used as:
    * LFO
    * inc conjunction with the MS20's external signal processor ESP to output control voltages

### Next Steps

* PWM inprovements - easing, interesting sounds, better control, "one shot" sounds. 
* frameworkize
* keyboard control
* midi notes to pwm frequency?
